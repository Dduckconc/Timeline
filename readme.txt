". . . all history is too small for even me;
for me and you,exceedingly too small."  -- e.e. cummings --

Facts, numbers, and names are not history.  

Just what is "history"?  

Coming up with a good definition for "history" is one of the objectives of this project.  Definitions can be powerful.  They can provide us with focus and scope.  Therefore, crafting appropriate definitions is a foundational activity for meaningful creation.

Collecting facts, numbers, and names is also a foundational activity.  While we should be careful not to confuse this collection AS history, we cannot deny its value to the study of history and its ultimate creative outcome: storytelling.

So, we are starting with building an index that we can use to reference and relate the events and experiences that make up history.  
(It seems likely that "events and experiences" will be at the core of our definition for history.)

We are launching this project as a family project.  However, our family has always held a very open idea of what a 'family' is.  We see little distinction between 'family' and 'community'.  Yet, as subtle as it is, we see a powerful difference.  Family encompasses the rich interpersonal concern, compassion, acceptance, and intimacy that is not necessarily a part of all communities.

If you choose to contribute to this project, you are welcome to join this community of amateur historians.  

However, if you are open-hearted and kind, you are very likely to find yourself also welcome into our family.
